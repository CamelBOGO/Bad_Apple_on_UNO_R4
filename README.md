## üßê About the Project

One year ago, BOGO has sucessfully played Bad Apple on an Arduino UNO R3 using an 8x8 LED matrix. Now, with the recent release of the Arduino UNO R4, which features a built-in 12x8 LED matrix, we have an exciting opportunity to take playing animation on LED matrix to the next level. So why not we also play Bad Apple on it?

### Demo

## üèÅ Getting Started

Before you embark on the exciting journey of playing Bad Apple on your Arduino UNO R4, make sure you have the necessary hardware components ready:

-   Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
-   DFPlayer Mini
-   Micro SD card
-   Speaker
-   Breadboard
-   Computer with Arduino IDE installed
-   USB cable for code uploading
-   Jumper wires (a few of them)

The code can be compiled and uploaded to Arduino UNO R4 directly by using Arduino IDE. If you're feeling adventurous and want to explore further possibilities, refer to the "Play My Own Video" section below to learn how you can customize and play your own videos. Get ready to unleash the full potential of your Arduino UNO R4 and immerse yourself in the captivating world of Bad Apple!

### Connections

Please connect the hardware as the following diagram:

(Diagram 1)

### Dependencies

To compile the code, you should install the following libraries in Arduino IDE:

Boards:

-   **Arduino UNO R4 Boards** by Arduino

Libraries:

-   **DFPlayerMini_Fast** by PowerBroker2

### Uploading Code

After connecting the UNO R4 to your computer, select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE, then click "Upload" button to upload the code to your UNO R4. When finished, Bad Apple will be played on your UNO R4.
